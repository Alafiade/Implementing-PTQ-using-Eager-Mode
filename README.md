# Implementing-PTQ-using-Eager-Mode
Implementng Post Training Quantization using Eager Mode on a ConvModel
# Project Overview
This project implements post training quantization in eager mode on a pretrained ResNet-18 Model using PyTorch's quantization capabilites. The implementation focuses on improvnf model efficiency whle maintaining acceptable accuracy levels.
